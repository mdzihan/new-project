                    The Disaster Relief Emergency Fund was established in 1985 and is supported by contributions from
                    donors. Each time a National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society needs immediate financial support to
                    respond to a disaster, it can request funds from the DREF. For small-scale disasters, the IFRC
                    allocates
                    grants from the Fund, which can then be replenished by the donors.
                    Through its European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), the European Union
                    helps
                    millions of victims of conflicts and disasters every year. For more information on EU Civil
                    protection
                    and Humanitarian Aid, please visit the website.

                    The European Commission has signed a €3 million humanitarian contribution agreement with the
                    International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to support the Federation's
                    Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF). Funds from the DREF are allocated to “small-scale” disasters
                    –
                    those that do not give rise to a formal international appeal.
